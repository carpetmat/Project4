Project 4: Hydrophone Report<br>
<br>
<p>
This project I was to download broadband hydrophone data from Oregon Shelf and Offshore Cabled Benthic Experiment Package and calculate the power spectral density as well as create a spectrogram of the data.

<p>
Compare the spectral levels in the figures above and answer the  following questions:
</p>

• What is the effect of wind and rain on underwater noise? Explain any behavior you observe in your result.

      Wind appears to have the greatest effect on underwater noise. However there is a discrepancy I cannot explain when comparing<br>         the wind and rain only data for the Oregon Offshore. They appear to be at similar dB levels. However looking at the wind <br>
      and rain at those times, nothing seems unusual.
      
• Which one has the highest impact? Rain or wind?

      test

• What are the main reasons for observing different spectral levels in Oregon shelf compared to Oregon offshore?

      test


<p>
For part 2 I will be attempting to find the following instances recorded in a spectrogram: A arigun, a marine mammal vocalization, and an earthquake.

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>airgun Spectrogram</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img alt="Aug 24th?" src=images/fig3.PNG><br></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Figure 3.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
The airgun noise seems apparent enough. Although these are low frequancy noises, it appears as though the sound caused by these devices bleeds into much higher frequencies.
</p>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>Mammal Vocalization Spectrogram</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img alt="Aug 24th?" src=images/fig4.PNG><br></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Figure 4.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
Marine mammal vocalizations appear harder to detect. Figure 4 supposedly shows a known time period of whale vocalizations. However from what I understand Whale vocalizations are under 40 Hz, and at arround 140db [1]. Noise prevented any clear vocalization at this frequency to been seen. There are a few interesting shapes seen in this spectrogram. But I believe the two taller shapes to be possibly an airgun, or some other instrument, as they are spaced almost identically spaced as the airgun sounds seen in figures 3 and 5.
</p>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>Earthquake Spectrogram</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><img alt="Aug 24th?" src=images/fig5.PNG><br></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Figure 5.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
Unfortunatly again I am unable to detect an earthquake with the spectrogram. As at present the noise in the data below 100 HZ is too high. Earthquakes generally produce even lower frequency sounds than Whales. However airguns again can be seen in this time range.
